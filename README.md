# YOLO vs TinyYOLO
Bachelor's Degree Thesis - Redacted in Italian

## Description
The main goal was to find the best machine learning model that could run on a tiny robot with very limited computational power in order to perform image recognition on road signs.

Given that speed was also a very important concern, the best fit looked to be the minimized version of the "YOLO" algorithm, based on a Convolutional Neural Network.

The model was finally trained also on a custom dataset collected within the real environment of "DuckieTown" built withing one of the laboratories of my University.
